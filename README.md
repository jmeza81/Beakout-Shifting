## About My Project (Breakout Shifting):

I started out with a couple ideas that were pretty much crap. I picked one and went in a slightly different direction 
which is now my current project which I'm calling Breakout Shifting. It's a program intended to help gearheads
calculate shift points in their specific vehicle so they can reach the finish line as fast as possible.
